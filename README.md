# Revenew prediction model
This is a research performed on a UCI dataset which has the **revenew** as the target column so I decide to perform my experiment using multiple machine learning model.
## Dataset
**Dataset Website** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/468/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset
Dataset Information The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 sessions. The dataset was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period.
## Models 
I had used multiple classification models like **Logistic Regression,DT (Gini),DT (Entropy),KNN**, because these are one of the best models to detect binary features
1. **Logistic Regression:**
Logistic Regression is a widely-used binary classification algorithm in machine learning. Despite its name, it's employed for predicting the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class. It models the relationship between the dependent binary variable and one or more independent variables using the logistic function, which maps any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1. By setting a threshold, predictions are made, with values above the threshold classified as one class and those below as the other. Logistic Regression is simple, interpretable, and effective for tasks like spam detection, medical diagnosis, and credit scoring.
2. **DTC or Decision Tree Classifier model:** The Decision Tree Classifier is a versatile supervised machine learning model used for both classification and regression tasks. It recursively splits the dataset based on the most significant features, creating a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents the predicted outcome. The algorithm selects the optimal splits by maximizing information gain or minimizing impurity. Decision trees are interpretable, handle non-linear relationships well, and are prone to overfitting. Ensembles like Random Forests mitigate this by aggregating multiple trees. They find applications in various fields, including finance, healthcare, and pattern recognition.
3. **KNN:**  The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is a simple and intuitive machine learning model used for classification tasks. It operates on the principle that similar instances in a dataset are likely to share the same class. During prediction, KNN calculates the class based on the majority vote of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space. The model is non-parametric and does not make assumptions about the underlying data distribution. KNN is versatile and effective, particularly in scenarios with well-defined clusters. However, it can be sensitive to the choice of the distance metric and the value of k, requiring careful consideration in practice.
## Summary
This Summary dataset clearly describes the maximum values by highlighting the max values of each column. So the Logistic Regression model is one of the best possible model to work on since it has maximum number of accuracy and precision with decent amount of Recall and F1 score.
